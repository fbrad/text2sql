- train.json:

    Contains 24594 entries, with the following structure:
    
```javascript
    {
        title       : "(string) Title provided in natural language that explains the meaning of the SQL query"
        description : "(string) A longer description of the query (may be missing)"
        sql_plain   : "(string) The original query, as it appeared on data.stackexchange"
        sql         : "(string) Query with comments removed"
        comments    : "(list of strings) List with the removed comments"
